# What is loid?

loid is an automation platform of the next generation.
In a nutshell, loid functions like a digital nervous system - receiving events from various sources, analyzing them
through modular components, and orchestrating the optimal solution without human intervention.

Unlike traditional procedural automation tools that follow rigid workflows, loid leverages agentic AI capabilities to
dynamically set goals, develop strategies, and make decisions based on real-time context.

The framework's open architecture allows for continuous extension through community-driven neuron development, making it
adaptable to diverse enterprise environments while maintaining security, auditability, and operational reliability.
